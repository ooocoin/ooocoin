Project introduction:
OOo is based on the wave field Tron as the underlying technology. It aims to break through the consensus of global social software common points, protect privacy by using blockchain, create a good online dating environment, save complex transaction modes and exchange rate differences, and make everyone open one-to-one.
Community KOL autonomy concept:
The mnemonics for creating mobile pool address accounts are divided into 12 and managed by community KOL respectively. The concept of community KOL managing mobile pool accounts is the first one issued by OOo project parties, and the top 12 will be elected by KOL from all over the world according to the voting. This move can ensure that OOo projects are almost impossible to be withdrawn from the mobile pool.
